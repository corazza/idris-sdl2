See [oREADME.org](https://github.com/corazza/idris-sdl2/blob/master/oREADME.org). These are just slight modifications of [https://github.com/steshaw/idris-sdl2](https://github.com/steshaw/idris-sdl2) for my game project in Idris. The code here is actively harmful and if I cared, I would remove it from public sight immediately.


The Idris SDL2 bindings used for the game. This is a separate repo because
it installs `sdl2` as an Idris package, and to initially pull in changes from
upstream more easily.
